# Overview

* This section of the course focuses on the foundational knowledge
required for understanding cyber security before diving into technical aspects.
* Cyber security involves a constant struggle between security and convenience,
where trade-offs must be made.
* Balancing security and convenience is a challenge both at home and
within organizations.
* The desire for convenience often compromises security,
leading to cyber attacks and data breaches.
* Major companies spend significant amounts,
around 1.3 million dollars per data breach, due to this trade-off.
* The section will cover foundational concepts such as the CIA triad
and triple As of security.
* Two key terms are defined:
information security and information systems security.
* Information security pertains to protecting data from unauthorized access,
modification, disruption, disclosure, corruption, and destruction.
* Information systems security focuses on safeguarding the devices 
(e.g., computers, servers, networks, smartphones) that hold
and process critical data.
* Section one provides an overview of various topics,
with more in-depth coverage in subsequent sections to prepare 
students for certification exams.

## CIA Triade

* The CIA triad is a foundational concept in cybersecurity, consisting of
three components: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
* Confidentiality ensures that information is not disclosed to unauthorized
individuals, both in the physical and digital world.
Encryption plays a key role in maintaining confidentiality.
* Integrity focuses on preventing unauthorized modification or
alteration of information. Maintaining the accuracy and trustworthiness of
data is crucial for preserving integrity.
* Availability ensures that information is accessible, stored,
and protected at all times. It is important for systems to be available
and functional when needed by users.
* The CIA triad works together to provide secure and usable systems.
Losing any of the components can create vulnerabilities that attackers may
exploit.
* Encryption, authentication, and hashes are examples of security measures
that contribute to achieving confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
* Understanding and applying the CIA triad is essential for building robust
security practices and protecting data and information effectively.
